# Expo Router Google Home 

This is an Expo Router app for interacting with Google Home / Nest devices.

This app uses the new Expo React Server Components (developer preview) and Expo DOM Components features.

To get running, you'll need to register for an API key in [Google Nest](https://console.nest.google.com/device-access/project-list).
